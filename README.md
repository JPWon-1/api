# JavaScript Everywhere API

This repository contains code examples for the API chapters of [_JavaScript Everywhere_](https://www.jseverywhere.io/) by Adam D. Scott, published by O'Reilly Media

## Getting Help

The best place to get help is our Spectrum channel, [spectrum.chat/jseverywhere](https://spectrum.chat/jseverywhere).

## Directory Structure

- `/src` If you are following along with the book, this is the directory where you should perform your development.
- `/solutions` This directory contains the solutions for each chapter. If you get stuck, these are available for you to consult.
- `/final` This directory contains the final working project

## To Use the Final Project Files

If you're developing a UI and would like to use the completed project, copy the files to the completed files to the `src` as follows: 

```
cp -rf ./final/* ./src/
```

## Seed Data

To seed data for local development: `npm run seed`. The password for all of the seeded users is `password`.

Each time this command is run, it will generate 10 users and 25 notes.

# JP 공부 기록용 fork repository 입니다.
이렇게 기록이라도 해야..뭐라도 남을까 싶어서 fork 했습니다
final은 최종 소스이고
solutions 는 문제 해결에 있어 참고할 소스들이 포함되어 있다고 원작자가 말했습니다.

저의 소스 커밋들은 src 에 계속 추가 될 예정입니다.

*  2021-05-05 : 개발 도구 세팅 및 clone project. express 프레임워크를 이용하여 간단한 hello world를 출력하는 과정까지 해보았다. nodemon을 설치하여 코드 변경사항이 있을 경우 서버를 자동으로 재시작 해주는것도 배웠다.
